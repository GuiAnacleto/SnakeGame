<h1 align="center">SNAKE GAME</h1>

<!--Description-->
<p align="center">The aim of this project is to learn my skills in different languages ​​creating a simple snake game. For each language used, I will try to extract the most efficient and least coding way to build the game.</p>

<!--Sumario-->

# Python 🐍:

<p align="justify">With the python language, the "pygame" library was used to create the screen and most of the game's elements. The idea was to create a snake using a vector. My main obstacle was the collisions, I solved this point by mapping the positioning of the elements on screen.</p>

### Status:

<p>Finished ✅</p>

### Installation: 🛠️

Krapper requires [`python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/) V3.8+ to run.

First you will need to install the libraries:

`Execute` this command in windows prompt `CMD` or `BASH` after installed python:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<p align="justify">This will install all librarys necessarys to run SnakeGame! After that you already can run the game! 😊.</p>

### Running: 🏃

To `Run` the game just do:

```bash
$ python game.py
```

# JavaScript 🟨:

<p align="justify">With javascript it is basically a code that draws and erases the snake along the way.</p>

### Status:

<p>Finished ✅</p>

### Running: 🏃

Just `Open` the game.html file:
